Design Document: Daily Paper Extractor
1. Overview
This document outlines the design for a web application called "Daily Paper Extractor." The application will allow a user to select a date, fetch a list of academic papers for that day from the Hugging Face daily_papers API, process each paper to extract key information (including the methodology from the source PDF), and display the results in a structured table.

2. Core Features
Date Selection: A user can input or select a specific date.

API Data Fetching: The application will call the Hugging Face API with the selected date to retrieve a list of daily papers.

Information Extraction: For each paper, the app will parse and store:

Paper Title

Authors

Abstract

Topics/Keywords

PDF Content Analysis: The application will download the PDF for each paper, convert it to text, and programmatically identify and extract the "Methodology" section.

Data Display: All extracted data will be presented to the user in a clear, sortable, and filterable table.

3. System Architecture
The application will be a client-server model to handle the processing-intensive task of PDF analysis securely and efficiently.

Frontend (Client-Side): A single-page web application (SPA) where the user interacts with the interface. It will be responsible for:

Displaying the date picker.

Sending the request to the backend.

Displaying the final extracted data in a table.

Showing the status of the processing job (e.g., "Fetching papers...", "Processing PDF 5 of 20...").

Backend (Server-Side): A server that acts as a middleman and a processing engine. It will be responsible for:

Receiving the date from the frontend.

Calling the external Hugging Face API.

Iterating through each paper in the API response.

Downloading the associated PDF file for each paper.

Using a PDF parsing library to extract raw text.

Running a text-analysis algorithm to find and extract the methodology section.

Aggregating all the data and sending it back to the frontend.

4. Detailed Workflow & Logic
User Input: The user selects a date (e.g., 2025-03-31) on the frontend and clicks a "Fetch Papers" button.

Frontend Request: The frontend sends a request to its own backend, for example: POST /api/get-papers with the body { "date": "2025-03-31" }.

Backend - API Call: The backend receives the request and constructs the URL for the external API call: https://huggingface.co/api/daily_papers?date=2025-03-31. It then fetches the data.

Backend - Initial Parsing: The backend parses the JSON response from Hugging Face. It iterates through the list of papers, extracting the title, authors, abstract, and tags (topics) for each one.

Backend - PDF Processing Loop: For each paper, the backend performs the following steps asynchronously:

Get PDF URL: It identifies the URL to the full PDF, which is typically available in the API response.

Download PDF: It downloads the PDF file into temporary memory or storage.

Extract Text: It uses a server-side library (e.g., pdf-parse in Node.js or PyMuPDF in Python) to convert the entire PDF into plain text.

Extract Methodology: It runs a function on the plain text to find the methodology. This function will:

Search for common methodology headings like "Methodology", "Methods", "Experimental Setup", "Approach", or "Materials and Methods". The search should be case-insensitive.

Once a heading is found, it will extract all the text that follows until it hits the next common heading (e.g., "Results", "Discussion", "Conclusion") or a predefined character limit to avoid capturing too much text.

If no specific heading is found, the "Methodology" field should be populated with a message like "Could not automatically determine."

Backend - Final Response: Once all papers have been processed, the backend compiles a final JSON array, where each object represents a paper and has the following structure:

{
  "title": "Paper Title Here",
  "authors": ["Author One", "Author Two"],
  "abstract": "The abstract of the paper...",
  "topics": ["Topic A", "Topic B"],
  "methodology": "The extracted methodology text..."
}

Frontend - Display: The frontend receives this JSON array and dynamically renders a table with the following columns: Paper Title, Authors, Abstract, Topics, and Methodology.

5. Data Model & Storage
The primary data is ephemeral and processed on-demand. No database is required for this initial design. The data structure for each paper will be a simple object as described in the section above.

Table Columns:

Column Name

Data Type

Description

title

String

The full name of the paper.

authors

Array of Strings

A list of the paper's authors.

abstract

String

The summary/abstract of the paper.

topics

Array of Strings

Keywords or topics associated with the paper.

methodology

String

The extracted methodology section from the PDF.

6. Technology Stack (Recommendation)
Frontend: A modern JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Svelte for building a dynamic user interface.

Backend:

Node.js with Express: A good choice for handling I/O-heavy operations like API calls and file downloads.

Python with Flask/FastAPI: An excellent choice, especially given the strong ecosystem of data processing and PDF manipulation libraries (like requests, PyMuPDF).

PDF Parsing Library:

For Node.js: pdf-parse

For Python: PyMuPDF or pdfplumber

7. Error Handling
Invalid Date: The backend should validate the date format.

API Failure: The backend should handle cases where the Hugging Face API is down or returns an error.

PDF Download Failure: If a PDF link is broken or the download fails, the "Methodology" field should indicate the failure (e.g., "Failed to download PDF").

PDF Parsing Error: If a PDF is corrupted or cannot be parsed, this should also be noted in the "Methodology" field.

Timeout: The process for a single paper should have a timeout to prevent the entire request from hanging on one problematic PDF.
